A few ideas to get the project going:

a. Public mode should not be fully public. I feel a public-use collaree should be available just for leashing and positioning. Having experimented a collar in public mode, i can say that one is exposed to too many things that can go wrong and so I feel that public mode should be limited to just those two things. Perhaps others if there is a good justification.
b. Public leashing: A collaree could be not public-use but his/her leash still be available to be grabbed. I think of this possibility for Gorean role play.
c. RLV should come as an add-on, and then when installed it should be OFF by default.
d. I don't know if it's a possibility, but perhaps it would be cool if the RLV outfits function was tweaked so that the outfit could be added and removed besides just wearing it.
e. For the love of everything pure let's get rid of the double collar safety check!!!
f. We should discuss the commands and see what can we come up with for well named alternatives. I'll elaborate more on this.

Cheers,
