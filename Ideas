A few ideas to get the project going:

a. Public mode should not be fully public. I feel a public-use collaree should be available just for leashing and 
   positioning. Having experimented a collar in public mode, i can say that one is exposed to too many things that can 
   go wrong and so I feel that public mode should be limited to just those two things. Perhaps others if there is a good justification.
b. Public leashing: A collaree could be not public-use but his/her leash still be available to be grabbed. 
   I think of this possibility for Gorean role play.
c. RLV should come as an add-on, and then when installed it should be OFF by default.
d. I don't know if it's a possibility, but perhaps it would be cool if the RLV outfits function was tweaked so that the outfit 
   could be added and removed besides just wearing it.
e. For the love of everything pure let's get rid of the double collar safety check!!!
f. We should discuss the commands and see what can we come up with for well named alternatives. I'll elaborate more on this.
g. There could be an enhancement to the leash. This could be a part of the RLV plugin, or be part of the leash per se.
   Essentially when a collaree uses RLV and the owner teleports, the collaree is automatically teleported to where the owner is.
   I don't know how feasible that would be,, but I know there is at least one device that allows for this.
h. Permissions. I think that mod/no copy/transfer permissions for prim work make for a more meaningful collar. 
   It also makes it more valuable, if we think of it in commercial terms, and for the collaree it is an incentive to take good care
   of the collar and protect it.
   
I am open to more suggestions, of course. Please let me know of anything.

Cheers,

Tenshi
